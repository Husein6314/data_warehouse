# 🏬 Super Store Data Warehouse
📊 Overview
Welcome to the Super Store Data Warehouse project! This project provides insights into sales, revenue, profit, and orders across different regions to support reporting and business decision-making.

## 🎯 Objective
To design a data warehouse that enables efficient reporting on key performance metrics, including:

Sales
Revenue
Profit
Order Quantities
📝 Business Problem
The Super Store business requires a consolidated view of its operations across various regions to make data-driven decisions. This data warehouse provides an overview of sales performance, helping the business track its progress and optimize strategies.

# 💾 Data Sources
Source Type: Flat files
File Format: CSV
Data Structure: Structured
🛠️ Architecture
The data warehouse follows a Star Schema design with the following layers:

Staging Layer: Raw data loaded from CSV files.
Core Layer: Cleaned and transformed data in star schema format.
Presentation Layer: Data prepared for reporting and dashboards.
🗂️ Schema Design
🔑 Fact Tables
factSales: Tracks sales transactions.
factReturns: Tracks product returns.
🛒 Dimension Tables
dimDate: Date and time attributes.
dimTerritory: Regional information.
dimCustomer: Customer details.
dimProducts: Product attributes.
🔗 Relationships:
Fact-to-Dimension Connections through primary and foreign keys to support complex queries.

## 🛠️ ETL Process
Tool Used: Pentaho Data Integration (PDI)

## Stages:
### Extract: Load data from CSV files.
### Transform: Handle data type conversions, key mappings, and error handling.
### Load: Populate staging and core layers in the MySQL database.
## ⚙️ Challenges Faced:
Data Type Mismatches: Resolved through data type transformations.
Relationship Constraints: Handled by pre-validating foreign keys before loading.
💾 Technology Stack
### Database: MySQL
### ETL Tool: Pentaho
### Environment: On-premise
## 🚀 Performance Optimization
### Indexes: Created on fact tables (SalesKey, CustomerKey, etc.) to improve query performance.
Optimized Joins: Between fact and dimension tables to reduce query execution time.
📊 Dashboards & Reporting
## Key Metrics Tracked:
### 💰 Total Revenue
### 📈 Profit
### 👥 Customer Count
### 🛍️ Order Quantity
Report Types:
Pie Charts: Customer segmentation by region.
Bar Charts: Sales by product category.
Line Charts: Monthly revenue trends.
🔍 Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
Here’s a simplified view of the schema design:

Copy code
CREATE TABLE dimDate (
  DateKey INT PRIMARY KEY,
  Date DATE,
  Year INT,
  MonthName VARCHAR(20),
  DayName VARCHAR(20)
);

CREATE TABLE factSales (
  SalesKey INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  DateKey INT,
  ProductKey INT,
  CustomerKey INT,
  TerritoryKey INT,
  TotalPrice DECIMAL(10, 2),
  FOREIGN KEY (DateKey) REFERENCES dimDate(DateKey)
);
## 🛡️ Maintenance and Support
## Backups:
Regular backups for staging and core layers.
## Monitoring:
Data Quality Checks: Regular validation of data integrity, including completeness, consistency, and uniqueness.
ETL Monitoring: Track ETL job success/failure and log performance metrics, such as load times.
## 🎨 Project Highlights
Star Schema Design for optimized reporting.
Pentaho ETL for automated data integration.
MySQL for robust data storage.
